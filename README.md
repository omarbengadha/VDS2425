To be able to reproduce the script, the line code number 7 needs to be replaced by the relative or absolute path of the 'VDS2425_Madrid' file.
In addition, a seperate python code was created for the 'pollution_trend_chart()' function which reproduces the 'OMR4_pollution_trend' plot.
The generated dataset will be included in the repository under the name of 'annual_pollution_2001_2018.csv' (the CSV file should be in the same folder of the main python code).
Note: the plots will all be opened one by one in a web browser and it may take some seconds between each plot.
